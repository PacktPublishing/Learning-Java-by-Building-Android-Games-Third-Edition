**Learn Java and Android from scratch by building five exciting games**

## What is this book about?
Android is one of the most popular mobile operating systems today. It uses the most popular programming language, Java, as one of the primary languages for building apps of all types. Unlike most other Android books, this book doesn’t assume that you have any prior knowledge of Java programming, instead helps you get started with building Android games as a beginner.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Set up a game development environment in Android Studio
* Respond to a player's touch and program intelligent enemies who can challenge the player in different ways
* Explore collision detection, animating sprite sheets, simple tracking and following, AI, parallax backgrounds, and particle explosions
* Animate objects at 60 FPS and manage multiple independent objects using OOP
* Work with design patterns such as OOP and singleton, strategy, and entity-component patterns

The code will look like the following:
```
/*
     This part of the code will
     handle detecting that the player
     has tapped the screen
*/
@Override
public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent motionEvent) {
   return true;
}
```
